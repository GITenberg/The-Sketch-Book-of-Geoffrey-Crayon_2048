description: The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, commonly referred to as The Sketch
  Book, is a collection of 34 essays and short stories written by Washington Irving.
  Published serially throughout 1819 and 1820, the collection includes two of Irving's
  best-known works, "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" and "Rip Van Winkle." It also marks
  Irving's first use of the pseudonym "Geoffrey Crayon," which he would continue to
  employ throughout his literary career. The Sketch Book, along with James Fenimore
  Cooper's Leatherstocking Tales, was the first widely read work of American literatu.
